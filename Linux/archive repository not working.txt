The simplest solution is to do the following two steps:

Backup your sources list sudo cp /etc/apt/sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list.backup
Open the sources file /etc/apt/sources.list and rename all the instances of us.archive or archive in

http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/

to

http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/

Also do the same for the http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/saucy-security/universe/binary-i386/Packages

Run sudo apt-get update after doing the above.

That should fix the issue.
